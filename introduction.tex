The \textit{Log-Rank Conjecture} of Lov\'{a}sz and Saks \cite{Lovasz1988} claims that the communication complexity of any boolean function $f: X\times Y \to \{0,1\}$ is a polynomial of the rank of the natural communication matrix. Despite decades of work, the best known bound, due to Lovett \cite{Lovett2013}, is $\sqrt{\mathsf{r}\log(\mathsf{r})}$. Given the challenges of showing general upper bounds, many authors focused on restricted classes of functions, especially functions of the form $f(g(x_1,y_1),g(x_2,y_2),\dots,f(x_n,y_n))$ where $f : \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ and $g : \{0,1\}\times\{0,1\}\to\{0,1\}$ is a ``gadget'' function. This direction has been
