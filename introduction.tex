The \textit{Log-Rank Conjecture} of Lov\'{a}sz and Saks \cite{Lovasz1988} claims that the communication complexity of any boolean function $f: X\times Y \to \{0,1\}$ is a polynomial of the rank of the natural communication matrix. Despite decades of work, the best known bound, due to Lovett \cite{Lovett2013}, is $\sqrt{\mathsf{r}\log(\mathsf{r})}$. Given the challenges of showing general upper bounds, many authors focused on restricted classes of functions, especially functions of the form $f(g(x_1,y_1),g(x_2,y_2),\dots,f(x_n,y_n))$ where $f : \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ and $g : \{0,1\}\times\{0,1\}\to\{0,1\}$ is a ``gadget'' function. This direction proved quite fruitful in \cite{Goos2015},\cite{Tsang2013},and \cite{Lovett2016}. 

In this note, we consider communication functions of the form $f(x_1 \wedge y_1,x_2\wedge y_2,\dots,x_n\wedge y_n)$ where $f : \{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}$ is a linear threshold function. Moreover, our methods follow the ideas of \cite{Lovett2016} in that we relate the Communication complexity to AND decision tree complexity.  Using these techniques, we show the following:
\begin{theorem}\label{mainresult}
	Let $f : \{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}$ be a linear threshold function. Form a communication function $F: \{0,1\}^n\times \{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}$ by $F(x_1,\dots,x_n,y_1,\dots,y_n)  = f(x_1 \wedge y_1,x_2\wedge y_2,\dots,x_n\wedge y_n)$. Let  $M_F$ be the communication matrix of $F$. Then $CC(F) \leq \mathsf{polylog}(\rank{M_F})$. 
\end{theorem}
