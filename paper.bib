abstract = {The quantum version of communication complexity allows the two communicating parties to exchange qubits and/or to make use of prior entanglement (shared EPR-pairs). Some lower bound techniques are available for qubit communication complexity, but except for the inner product function, no bounds are known for the model with unlimited prior entanglement. We show that the log-rank lower bound extends to the strongest model (qubit communication + unlimited prior entanglement). By relating the rank of the communication matrix to properties of polynomials, we are able to derive some strong bounds for exact protocols. In particular, we prove both the "log-rank conjecture" and the polynomial equivalence of quantum and classical communication complexity for various classes of functions. We also derive some weaker bounds for bounded-error quantum protocols.},

Equivalently, any graph whose adjacency matrix has rank r has chromatic number at most 2O(√r{\textperiodcentered}log(r)). This gives a nearly quadratic improvement in the dependence on the rank over previous results. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

We consider three properties: (i) the number of nonzero Fourier coefficients; (ii) the sum of the absolute value of the Fourier coefficients; and (iii) the size of the linear subspace spanned by the nonzero Fourier coefficients. For quadratic polynomials, tight relations are known between all three quantities. In this work, we extend this relation to higher degree polynomials. Specifically, for degree {\$}d{\$} polynomials, we show that the three quantities are equivalent up to factors exponential in {\$}d{\$}.},
