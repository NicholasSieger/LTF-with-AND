	\begin{abstract}
		In this paper, we show that the Log-rank conjecture holds for linear threshold functions (LTFs) of the form $f \circ \wedge$. The result relies on conjecture holding for montone functions of the same form. We show that any LTF can be recursively broken down into montone functions. We further explore the multilinear polynomial of functions of the form $f \circ \wedge$ and give characterizations of its the monomial complexity in terms of the support of the function.

	\section{Conclusion}
	Using subroutines for monotone functions in an iteration for which the log-rank conjecture holds, we have inductively shown that the log-rank conjecture holds for all LTFs of the form $f \circ \wedge$. Although this result heavily uses a previous result, we conjecture that this algorithm is the optimum  AND Decision Tree algorithm. Our result uses \cite{Buhrman1999} to show the log-rank conjecture for the communication complexity. An interesting problem would be to show it holds for the AND Decision Tree complexity also.
