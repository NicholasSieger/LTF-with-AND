In this section we show how an LTF can be broken down into monotone and antimonotone functions. We provide an \textsf{AND} Decision Tree algorithm to compute an LTF based on this decomposition. We use the fact that the Log-Rank holds for monotone functions as and algorithm to compute them as a subroutine for our query algorithm. We then characterize the polynomials of LTFs showing that they're `made up' of the monotone and antimonotone functions we used to compute it.

Throughout this section we will assume that $f$ is a linear threshold function (LTF) of the form $f(x) = w_1x_1 + ... w_nx_n > w_0$. We assume  without loss of generality that $w_0 \geq 0$. For an input $x$, we will denote $W_f(x)$ to denote the set $\{w_i \ | \ x_i = 1\}$ for the LTF $f$. We then define $W^+_f(x)$ to be subset of $W_f(x)$ that has positive weights and correspondingly we define $W^-_f(x)$. Similarly, we define $x^+$ and $x^-$ to be the substrings of $x$ that correspond to the positive and negative weights respectively.

\begin{definition}
	An input $x$ is a $\mathsf{pivot}$ if $f(x) = 1$ and for any $x_i = 1$, flipping $x_i$ to $0$, i.e. $x^{-i}$, causes the function value to flip, i.e. $f(x^{-i}) = 0$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	An input $x$ is an $\mathsf{antipivot}$ if $f(x) = 0$ and for any $x_i = 1$ and $w_i < 0$, we have that $f(x^{-i}) = 1$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{fact}\label{fact1}
	There does not exist an input $x'$ and a pivot $x$ such that $S_{x'} \subset S_x$ and $f(x') = 1$. Similarly, this extends to bits corresponding to negative weights in antipivots. 
\end{fact}

The concept of function restrictions easily extends to LTFs. We shall consider the restrictions that restrict some of the input bits to $1$. Let $f_x$ be defined as the function that is restricted to the $0$ bits of $x$. Clearly, the restricted function $f_x$ has weights $\{w_1, ..., w_n\} \backslash W_f(x)$ and has the condition that the linear combination of weights must be more than $w_0 - \sum_{w_i \in W_f(x)} w_i$. Notice that now that this expression is negative for any LTF that has non-zero support. We will define the sets $P_f, A_f$ to be the set of inputs $x$ for $f$ that are pivots and antipivots respectively. 

We are now ready to propose the \textsf{AND} Decision Tree (ADT) algorithm that computes $f(x)$. 

\begin{algorithm}[H]\label{alg1}
\KwIn{$x \in \{0, 1^n\}$}
\While{$f$ is not a constant function}{
	\eIf{$\exists p \in P_f$ such that $p \subset x$}{
		\eIf{$\exists a \in A_{f_p}$ such that $a \subset x$}{$f \leftarrow f_{p + a}$}
		{\KwRet{1}}		
	}{\KwRet{0}}
}
\KwRet{value of $f$}
\caption{LTF Decision Tree Query Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}


We now analyse the communication complexity of the protocol that simulates this \textsf{AND} Decision Tree query algorithm based on the monomial complexity. Let us first show that in lines 2, 3 the pivot and antipivots can be found in polylogarithmic number of queries in the number of monomials of the original function $f$. To do so, we shall define two functions; define the function $f'(x) = 1 \iff \exists p \in P_f \ | \ p \subseteq x$ and for some fixed pivot $p \in P_f$, we define $f^p(x) = 1 \iff \exists a \in A_{f_p} \ | \ a \subseteq x$.  


\begin{proposition}\label{prop1}
	$f'(x)$ and $f^p(x)$ are monotone 
	\begin{proof}
		Since there cannot be a pair of pivots (antipivots) where one is a subset of another from Fact \ref{fact1}, the set $P_f$ $(A_{f_p})$ form a building set for the monotone function. 
	\end{proof}
\end{proposition}

Recall that a building set for a monotone function correspond to the inputs in the support with minimum Hamming weight that are not subsets of each other.

The functions $f', \neg f^p$ can clearly be used directly to compute lines 2, 3 respectively in the algorithm. As per \cite{Buhrman1999,Lovasz1993}, the log-rank conjecture holds for monotone functions and thus there exists communication protocols that compute these functions in polylogarithmic number of communicated bits in the number of their monomials. It is left to show $\mathsf{mon}(f'), \mathsf{mon}( \neg f^p) \leq \mathsf{mon}(f)$.

We shall show a property about monotone functions and their monomials before we reason about the monomial complexity of $f', \neg f^p$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma2}
	If $g:\{0, 1\}^n \rightarrow \{0, 1\}$ is a monotone function and let $M \subset \{0,1\}^n$ be the building set for $g$, then we have that $$g(x) = \sum_{k=1}^{|M|} \ \sum_{A \subseteq M, |A| = k} -1^{k-1} \bigcup_{a \in A} a$$ where a string represents a monomial corresponding to its characteristic set and the union of strings is the union of their characteristic sets.

	\begin{proof}
		Consider any input $x$ in $\sup(g)$. Let $A \subseteq M$ such that $\forall a \in A, \ a \subseteq x$. We can assume that $x$ is simply a union of strings from $A$ since the suggested polynomial contains monomials only of that form. It is easy to see that inputs not in the support will be evaluate to $0$ since the function is monotone and the polynomial contains monomials only in the support. Since every monomial $y = \bigcup_{z \in A'}z$ such that $A' \subseteq A$ will evaluate to 1, we will have that the polynomial reduces to $\sum_{i=1}^{|A|} -1^{i-1} \binom{|A|}{i}$. We can see that this sum evaluates to 1 by looking at the binomial expansion of  \\ $ -1((1 - 1)^{|A|} - \binom{|A|}{0}) = (\sum_{k = 0}^{|A|} -1^{k+1} \binom{|A|}{k}) + \binom{|A|}{0}$.
	\end{proof}

\end{lemma}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop2}
	The monomials of the function $f'(x), \neg f^p(x)$ are contained in those of $f(x)$; taking into account the restriction of $f$ in $f^p$. 
	\begin{proof}
		Let us first consider $f'$. Notice that any monomial in $f'$, as per Lemma \ref{lemma2}, is a union of pivots. For all $s \in \sup(f)$ of this form (a union of pivots), $s$ has the property that any $s' \in \sup(f)$ with $s' \subseteq s$ also occurs in $\sup(f')$ and vice versa. Thus, as per Lemma \ref{lemma1}, the quantity $(-1)^{\order{s}}(\order{E_s} - \order{O_s})$ is the same in $f$ and $f'$. 

		Now, let us consider $\neg f^p$ where $p \in P_f$. The support of $\neg f^p$ is characterized by all $s$ such that $\not \exists a \in A_{f_p} \ | \ a \subseteq s$. By the definition of an antipivot, $(p \cup s) \in \sup(f)$. Thus, by Lemma \ref{lemma1}, any monomial $a$, which is a union of antipivots from $A_{f_p}$, must occur as $p \cup a$ in $f$. 
	\end{proof}
\end{proposition}
